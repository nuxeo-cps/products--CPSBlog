Specs notes for CPSBlog
=======================

Author: S. Fermigier
Written: 26/12/2004

Goals
-----

1. Blogging tool to be used for personal weblogs (me: fermigier.com, hopefully
others), the Nuxeo intranet (for knowledge building and developers logging) and
the Nuxeo public websites (linux-center, zopefr, pythonfr, openofficefr...).

2. Must support syndication and aggregation, so that one doesn't need to
post the same news on 3 or 5 different web sites. Publication on different
sites will be supported by rules and/or workflow.

4. Start simple, but expect to become powerful. Think "knowledge management":
Should be thought as a tool for collective knowledge building, not only for
news publishing.

5. Use the CPS Platform framework as much as possible, but don't overdo it.
