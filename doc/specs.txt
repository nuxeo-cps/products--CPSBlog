Specs notes for CPSBlog
=======================

Author: S. Fermigier
First draft: 26/12/2004
Current version: $Id$

Goals
-----

1. Blogging tool to be used for personal weblogs (me: fermigier.com, hopefully
others), the Nuxeo intranet (for knowledge building and developers logging) and
the Nuxeo public websites (linux-center, zopefr, pythonfr, openofficefr...).

2. Must support syndication and aggregation, so that one doesn't need to
post the same news on 3 or 5 different web sites. Publication on different
sites will be supported by rules and/or workflow. ATOM will be the prefered
format for syndication, RSS will also be supported.

4. Start simple, but expect to become powerful over time. Think "knowledge
management": Should be thought as a tool for collective knowledge building over
time, not only for publishing news that get forgotten afterwards.

5. Use the CPS Platform framework as much as possible, but don't overdo it.
CPSBlog is not intended to be a standalone blog system (based on CPS platform)
like Blogger or LiveJournal, but a blogging tool available inside of CPS
alongside other CPS servcices (NB: that may change in the future). So services
(like CPSSkins for template management) that are available in CPS must not be
duplicated. But integration between services must be seamless.

(Mn = Milestone targets).

M1:

x Posting a new blog entry is very easy
    - One button or link "New blog entry" for users with a personal blog

    possible il the future).

M2:

x Add a "Search this blog" box like in MT
x Blog entries are multilingual (I can post in french or english if I want,
    for instance) - blog owner should be able to select list of languages
    he wants to post in (if there is only one one language then there is no
    widget to select) - but not need to think about translations

x Comments
o Templates - way to select design from a library (or create one's own)
o It's easy to add new categories from the posting form

M3:

x URLs include date and words from the title
    Ex: http://xxx/blog/2004/12/15/christmas_today
    Or: http://xxx/blog/2004_12_15_christmas_today
    (2nd is inferior, though).
x Archive URLs
    Ex: http://xxx/blog/archive/2004/12
 Export blog content using RSS and ATOM XML
    - Must be able to selectively export content using rules
o Nested categories
x  "< (previous title) | main | (next title) >" navigation on blog entry
o Category management: make easy to edit categories, to move posts en masse
    from one category to another

    - readers can subscribe to a blog ans receive blog entries or just
      summaries in their mail, maybe as a daily or weekly digest
    - writer may be notified of comments on his/her postings
x Firefox Live bookmark support for blogs and blog aggregators
o ... and for the home page

M4:

    http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/)
o Automatic trackbacks to a service like http://pingomatic.com/
o Use categories / tags to interact with:
    http://topicexchange.com/
    Technorati
    Many others...
o One can easily add images in the text flow
o Stats
o Box / portlets with
  - All categories
  - Latest comments
  - Latest trackbacks
o Restrict navigation to only selected languages (using a cookie to keep
  settings)

M5:

o "Control panel" or "dashboard" that presents a synthetic view of important
    information to the blog manager
o Post using email (w/ PGP signature ?)
o Support one or more Blog API (via REST or XML-RPC) like MetaWeblogAPI,
    BloggerAPI and ATOM API
o Smart rating (with meta-rating) - think Slashdot, Kuro5hin, advogato,
    lxer.com, linux-community.com
o Automatic categorisation of blogs: "Similar posts" using either linguistic
    analysis or collaborative filtering.

M6:

o Anti-spam on comments
o "Object oriented" blog entries. Examples:
    - MovieBlogEntry (for blogging about movies: will include link to relevant
        information on IMDB and show a picture of the movie)
    - BookBlogEntry (will include ISBN, show book cover and link Amazon or
        other online bookshop/library)
    - SoftwareBlogEntry (for blogging about a piece of software: will include
        link to sourceforge, freshmeat, zope.org...)
    - TravelBlogEntry (will include geolocation information for putting entries
        on a map)
    - SysAdminBlogEntry (I've just upgraded such server and nothing works
      anymore)
    - DeveloperBlogEntry (I'm a software developer, I worked on such and such
      project for so much time today)
    - ProjectManagerBlogEntry (...)
    - SalesBlogEntry (???)
    ...
