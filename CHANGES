  <mario [at] curiango.ipen.br>)
-
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed #963, #979, #991. They are related. (Thanks to all reporters and
  Steve Meaker for proposed fix).
- Fixed #984 (Metadata link on blog object led to 'edit' screen of blog
  instead of presenting 'metadata' page). Metadata action is put into invisible
  mode. This is fixed also for BlogEntry.
- Fixed #522(Incoherent formatting of entries) by using Text Widget with 'html'
  rendering mode instead of Rich Text Editor Widget.
- Fixed #980 (action icons in IE were displayed as shifted to the right).
  Thanks to Steve Meaker for reporting and suggested solution.
- Fixed #855 (CPSBlog Local roles management page is obsolete). Now it uses
  standard folder_localrole_form in it's local role action. To present only
  BlogManager and BlogPoster roles changes were made in
  CPSDefault/MemberShip.py in getCPSCandidateLocalRoles method.
