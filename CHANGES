Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- #1892: "Make it possible to directly give read access to a blog".
- Rationalized the icons used for CPS blogs and blog entries to make them come
  from CPSDefault as much as possible.
- Removed now useless (pre-GenericSetup) files.
- Made blog_entry_view.pt be valid XHTML.
- Made the full name of blog posters be displayed for anonymous users instead of
  the member ID.
- Field "accept_trackback_pings" is now a Boolean field instead of an Int field
  (which is cleaner) and is False by default because trackback pings have now
  been made useless by spammers.
- Added an actionicon for the "Manage blog categories" action.
