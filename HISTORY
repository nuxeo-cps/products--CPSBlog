** CPSBlog V0.6.0 [R1 build 2005/11/07-15:08 by fguillaume]
** SVN URL: https://svn.nuxeo.org/pub/CPSBlog/trunk Revision: 29055
Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- updated Brazilian Portuguese translations (Thanks to Mario Olimpio de Menezes
  <mario [at] curiango.ipen.br>)
-
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed #963, #979, #991. They are related. (Thanks to all reporters and
  Steve Meaker for proposed fix).
- Fixed #984 (Metadata link on blog object led to 'edit' screen of blog
  instead of presenting 'metadata' page). Metadata action is put into invisible
  mode. This is fixed also for BlogEntry.
- Fixed #522(Incoherent formatting of entries) by using Text Widget with 'html'
  rendering mode instead of Rich Text Editor Widget.
- Fixed #980 (action icons in IE were displayed as shifted to the right).
  Thanks to Steve Meaker for reporting and suggested solution.
- Fixed #855 (CPSBlog Local roles management page is obsolete). Now it uses
  standard folder_localrole_form in it's local role action. To present only
  BlogManager and BlogPoster roles changes were made in
  CPSDefault/MemberShip.py in getCPSCandidateLocalRoles method.

** CPSBlog V0.5.0 [R1 build 2005/09/21-14:49 by fguillaume]
** SVN URL: https://svn.nuxeo.org/pub/CPSBlog/trunk Revision: 27306
Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Cache parameters for the BlogAggregator Portlet are available in the ZMI.
- Add simple anti-trackback-spam (needs more heuristics)
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- The blog aggregator, blog archive and blog category portlets could not
  be placed outside blogs in the site structure (#881).
- removed the 'custom_cache_params' schema field set to 'no-cache'.
  This is meant to be used with Custom Portlets only.
  Also this is redundant: if no cache parameter is found for a given portlet
  then 'no-cache' will be used by default.
  Also setting the parameter here make it impossible to set other cache
  parameters since 'no-cache' will be appended and override all other
  parameters.
  To update cache parameters, the portal_cpsportlets updateCacheParameters()
  should be used instead. (see also the 'Cache parameters' tab in the ZMI)
- Cleanup setting of EffectiveDate for the storage adapter (use DateTime).
